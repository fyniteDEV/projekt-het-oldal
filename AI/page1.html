    <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on creating machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. The goal of AI research is to create systems that can learn from data, identify patterns and make predictions or decisions with human-like or better accuracy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Artificial Intelligence has made significant progress in simulating human perception in various domains such as image and speech recognition. However, there is still a long way to go before AI can truly match human perception.
      For example, a human can easily identify objects in an image and understand the relationships between them, while current AI systems struggle with this type of reasoning.
