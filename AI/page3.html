  <h2>Advancements in AI</h2>
  <p>Artificial Intelligence is a rapidly growing field, with new developments and breakthroughs happening regularly. Here are a few examples of recent advancements in AI:<p>
  <ul>
    <li class="list">
      <button class="toggleBtn" onclick="displayChange('text31')">Deep Learning</button>
      <p id="text31" style="display: none">Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that involves neural networks with multiple layers. These networks are capable of learning and improving from large amounts of data, leading to breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.</p></li>
    <li class="list">
      <button class="toggleBtn" onclick="displayChange('text32')">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</button>
      <p id="text32" style="display: none">NLP is a branch of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. Advancements in NLP have enabled computers to understand, generate, and respond to human speech with greater accuracy, making it possible for AI systems to interact with users in a more human-like manner.</p></li>
    <li class="list">
      <button class="toggleBtn" onclick="displayChange('text33')">Computer Vision</button>
      <p id="text33" style="display: none">Computer vision is the ability of a computer to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos. Advances in computer vision have made it possible for AI systems to perform tasks such as object detection and image recognition with human-like or better accuracy.</p></li>
    <li class="list">
      <button class="toggleBtn" onclick="displayChange('text34')">Robotics</button>
      <p id="text34" style="display: none">AI is increasingly being integrated into robots, making them more autonomous and capable of performing tasks that were previously only possible for humans. For instance, robots can now perform complex tasks such as assembly, inspection, and maintenance in various industries.</p></li>
    <li class="list">
      <button class="toggleBtn" onclick="displayChange('text35')">Reinforcement Learning</button>
      <p id="text35" style="display: none">Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that involves training AI systems through trial-and-error, where the system receives rewards or penalties based on its actions. This approach has shown promising results in various domains, including robotics, gaming, and autonomous navigation.</p></li>
